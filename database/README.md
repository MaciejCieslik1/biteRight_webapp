# Database Description
The BiteRight database consists of 18 core tables and 3 optimized views, creating a robust relational data architecture that handles multiple interconnected aspects of health and nutrition tracking through four distinct layers: the User Management Layer which handles authentication, profiles, and personal preferences; the Nutrition Tracking Layer that manages recipes, ingredients, meals, and dietary limits; the Health Monitoring Layer which tracks weight history, exercise data, and water intake; and the Analytics Layer that provides summarized views for performance optimization, all working together to support comprehensive user management, nutritional tracking, meal planning, exercise monitoring, and health analytics for the BiteRight application.

## TABLES

## Database Triggers
All 8 of the triggers described below are defined in the following file: *database_2_functions.sql*.
### 📝 INSERT_HISTORICAL_LIMITS
Saves nutritional values to limit_history when new daily limits are created. Captures calories, protein, fat, carbs, and water goals with timestamp and user ID.

### 🗄️ UPDATE_HISTORICAL_LIMITS
Creates backup in limit_history when daily limits are modified. Preserves previous values before changes are applied.

### 📝 INSERT_USER_WEIGHT_HISTORY
Records initial weight in weight_history when new user profile is created. Captures starting point for weight tracking.

### ⚖️ UPDATE_USER_WEIGHT
Updates user_info.weight when new weight_history record is added. Keeps current weight synchronized in user profile.

### 📊 CALC_NEW_USER_BMI
